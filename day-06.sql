-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL
--

-- My Solution:

WITH annual_snow
  AS
  (
  SELECT resort_id,resort_name, 
  ROUND(SUM(snowfall_inches),2) AS total_snow
FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
GROUP BY resort_id,resort_name
ORDER BY total_snow DESC
  )
SELECT resort_id,resort_name,NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_snow DESC)
FROM annual_snow;
