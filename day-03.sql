-- Difficulty: hard
--
-- Question:
-- The Grinch has brainstormed a ton of pranks for Whoville, but he only wants to keep the top prank per target, with the highest evilness score. Return the most evil prank for each target. If two pranks have the same evilness, the more recently brainstormed wins.

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_prank_ideas
--   prank_id: INTEGER
--   target_name: VARCHAR
--   prank_description: VARCHAR
--   evilness_score: INTEGER
--   created_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH top_pranks AS
   (SELECT target_name,evilness_score,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER 
    (PARTITION BY target_name ORDER BY evilness_score DESC, created_at DESC) AS rnk
FROM grinch_prank_ideas
)
   SELECT target_name,evilness_score
   FROM top_pranks
   WHERE rnk = 1;
   
;
